<p>This summer, I kept myself busy and was a lifeguard at a country club back home in Alabama. I also took many beach trips to Florida and once to North Carolina with my friends from high school. However, the highlight of my summer was definitely seeing Beyonc√© in concert in Atlanta! It was definitely the best concert I've ever seen, and Jay Z was also a surprise guest at the show I went to!</p>
