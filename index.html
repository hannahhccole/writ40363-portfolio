<p>My name is Hannah Cole, and this is my introduction! Here is a little bit about me and my future aspirations! I'm a double major in Theatre and Digital Culture/Data Analytics, hoping to one day pursue careers as a performer/choreographer and web designer.</p>

<h2>Featured Work</h2>

<p>So far, my employment opportunities have included being an assistant in ballet and acting classes for children, a camp counselor for a showchoir summer camp, and a lifeguard at a country club. Though each of these jobs are very different, all required me to interact with others in various capacities, including follow directions of a supervisor as well as serving as a mentor to those younger than me. </p>

<h2>Current Learning</h2>
<p>This semester, I am taking an Intro to Web Design course. So far, we are learning how to use HTML and organize files for that efficiently. HTML is the "backbone" of a website. It allows you to insert text, pictures, and links with a very basic format. However, soon we will be learning how to use CSS to enhance the layout of the page. </p>
