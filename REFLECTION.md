#My HW3 Reflection

<b>1. Confidence Check</b>
So far, I feel like I am doing a lot better with HTML than I thought I would be doing. I understand the file organization, how the code should be set up, how to insert text, pictures, and videos, and now how to use GitHub to save and share my work. Nothing has been overwhelmingly difficult so far, which is good. 

<b>2. Learning Curve</b>
The idea of version control is still very new to me and I'm still trying to remember/fully understand how it all works. However, I do feel like I understand how to use GitHub to commit and push my work to save it. While it is another added step to think about, it's not that difficult.

<b>3. Problem-Solving Growth</b>
Luckily, I feel like I haven't encountered any major issues so far. However, if I'm ever confused about something, I've found it useful to go back and reference the Lab instructions to see where I've made a mistake. Especially this week, I feel more comfortable with understanding the instructions outside of class and applying them by myself.

<b>4. Professional Mindset</b>
I'm excited that our "web pages" will start to look more like real websites soon. The more "artistic" side of web design is exciting to me and I can't wait to have the skills necessary to accomplish that. The only concerning part is that it means the code will get more complicated and might be harder to keep track of. However, I feel like I'll quickly get the hang of it. 

<b>5. Week 2 Reflection</b>
I think how to easily navigate VS Code really clicked for me this week. Before I had a hard time remembering things like which button shows the preview and how to wrap the text; however, it all seemed much easier this week and I didn't have to think really hard about things like that.

<b>6. Looking Forward</b>
I'm really excited to start incorporating the CSS into our web development soon. I think it'll be really interesting to see how that is different from the HTML we've been working on and how they work together to start making something that looks closer to a real website. 

<b>7. Support Resources</b>
So far, the hands on practice in class has been the most useful to me. As someone who has never worked with code before this class, it makes it a lot less intimidating to walk through it together during class and make sure I know what I'm doing before I go home and finish the assignment. Having the examples on the board to watch as we go through it step by step also helps, as it allows me to compare my screen and make sure I'm doing everything right.
