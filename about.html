    <h1>About Me</h1>

<section>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>


<p>My name is Hannah Cole and I am 20 years old. I’m a sophomore double-majoring in <strong>Theatre</strong> and <strong>DCDA</strong>. I am originally from Virginia Beach, VA, but I recently moved to Birmingham, Alabama, with my family. At home, I live with my parents, sister, brother, and my Australian Labradoodle puppy, Simba. I may be biased, but I think he’s the cutest puppy I’ve ever seen!</p>

<h2 id="skillsandlearning">Skills and Learning</h2>

<p>A few things I excel in are organization, communication, and problem-solving. All three of those skills have helped me succeed in learning HTML so far. For example, I have found it pretty easy to keep all of the sections of code organized and in order, despite this type of platform being completely new to me.</p>
<p>I'm a quick learner and adaptable to situations, which is allowing me to succeed so far in this class. I'm learning patience, as there are many steps to web design and in many situations I have to go back and reference the list of instructions to insure I am doing everything correctly. </p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<!-- this paragraph contains italics -->

<p>When I’m not busy with all things theatre and dance related, I like to read, journal, go shopping, or just hang out with friends! Back home in Virginia Beach, my friends and I love to go to the beach either during the day or at night for sunset. I also live to take my dog, Simba, on long walks around the neighborhood when I am visiting my family in Birmingham. Fun fact: My favorite TV show is <em>Dance Moms</em> and I’ve watched all of Season 8 four times.

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>In this class, I hope to get a baseline understanding of how websites are structured and even insight on how to begin the process of designing a website. I’m really interested in the design aspect and how different pictures, colors, and fonts are implemented when creating a website. Post-grad, I hope to work in something related to digital marketing/web design, and specifically designing personal websites for performers. </p>
