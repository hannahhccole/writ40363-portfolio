    <h2>About Me</h2>

<section>

<h3>Background</h3>


<p>My name is Hannah Cole and I am 20 years old. I’m a sophomore double-majoring in <b>Theatre</b> and <b>DCDA</b>. I am originally from Virginia Beach, VA, but I recently moved to Birmingham, Alabama, with my family. At home, I live with my parents, sister, brother, and my Australian Labradoodle puppy, Simba. I may be biased, but I think he’s the cutest puppy I’ve ever seen!</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>With my double major in Theatre and Digital Culture/Data Analytics, I hope to have a career as a professional actor/choreographer, while also pursing work in web design. While I have a passion for all things singing and dancing, I know pursing a career as a performer is quite difficult, especially in NYC. This is why I have chosen to also puruse web design as another source of income but also another career I am passionate about. </p>

<h3>Interests</h3>

<!-- this paragraph contains italics -->

<p>When I’m not busy with all things theatre and dance related, I like to read, journal, go shopping, or just hang out with friends! Back home in Virginia Beach, my friends and I love to go to the beach either during the day or at night for sunset. I also live to take my dog, Simba, on long walks around the neighborhood when I am visiting my family in Birmingham. Fun fact: My favorite TV show is <i>Dance Moms</i> and I’ve watched all of Season 8 four times.

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>In this class, I hope to get a baseline understanding of how websites are structured and even insight on how to begin the process of designing a website. I’m really interested in the design aspect and how different pictures, colors, and fonts are implemented when creating a website. Post-grad, I hope to work in something related to digital marketing/web design, and specifically designing personal websites for performers. </p>
